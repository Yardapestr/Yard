## 1.  Summary

This BEP describes a proposal for conducting Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) on the Binance Chain.

## 2.  Abstract

A specification for running IEOs directly on Binance Chain. This specification attempts to provide details on how the 
currently active IEO process (as of May 29, 2019) can be transplanted to run on Binance Chain, including any necessary 
modifications to the chain protocol itself.

## 3.  Status

This BEP is in Draft status.

## 4.  Motivation

Several IEOs have been successfully conducted on Binance.com. However, they lack the benefits of transparency and 
decentralization which Binance Chain provide. Furthermore, it seems that most (if not all) IEOs (Harmony.One) result in 
contributors being awarded BEP-2 tokens that are native to Binance Chain. Thus it makes sense to take things one step 
forwards and conduct the IEO itself on Binance Chain, thus providing far greater transparency and auditability to 
the lottery process.

In summation, here are some of the benefits:

* Greater transparency and auditability, thereby increasing trust in the IEO process, and thus its popularity.
* No need to bridge from Binance.com to Binance Chain (i.e. BNB no longer needs to be sent to Binance.com in order 
to participate, thus reducing participant risk).
* Faster turnaround time from IEO to tradeability of crowdfunded token, since the offered token is already present on Binance Chain.
