## 1. Summary 
This BEP proposes to make the Fast Finality voting rewards in block transaction fees governable.

## 2. Abstract 
This BEP makes Fast Finality rewards governable while maintaining the distribution ratio of block transaction fees unchanged.

## 3. Motivation 
The introduction of the Fast Finality feature in BSC significantly reduces the time for transaction final confirmation, providing a substantial advantage for BSC compared to other EVM-compatible chains. However, the current reward proportion in block transaction fees is approximately 1/16, leading to a lack of incentive for some validators to participate in voting, thereby reducing the stability expectation of the Fast Finality feature. This BEP makes Fast Finality rewards governable, laying the groundwork for future reward enhancements.

## 4. Specification
### 4.1 Existing Allocation Logic

</div>
The existing allocation steps are as follows:

1. Validators collect transaction fees from within the block.
2. In the client, if the balance of the SystemRewardContract is less than 100 BNB, 1/16 of the collected transaction fees is allocated as rewards for relayers and Fast Finality voting. The remainder is deposited into the ValidatorContract.
3. Within the ValidatorContract, 10% of the deposited amount is burned directly, and the remainder serves as potential earnings for validators and stakers.

### 4.2 Allocation Logic Moved to the Contract 
<div align="center">

</div>
Due to the deposition of the SystemRewardContract being in the client, requiring hard forks for each change, and for ease of governance, it is moved to the smart contract. The adjusted allocation logic is as follows:

1. Validators collect transaction fees from within the block and deposit all into the ValidatorContract.
2. Deposit finalityRewardRatio of transaction fees into the SystemRewardContract, where finalityRewardRatio is governable, with an initial value of 1/16.
3. Within the ValidatorContract, 9.375% of the deposited amount is burned directly, and the remainder serves as potential earnings for validators and stakers.
### 4.3 Maintain Burn Ratio 
The real-time burning mechanism is an essential part of the BNB deflation plan. In this BEP, the goal is to maintain it essentially unchanged. Before the implementation of this BEP, the proportion of burned transaction fees to block transaction fees is (1-1/16) * 10% = 9.375%. Therefore, after the implementation of this BEP, the burnRatio is modified to 9.375%.
