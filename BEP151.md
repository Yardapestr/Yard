# BEP-151: Prune DEX from Beacon Chain

## 1. Summary
This BEP proposes to prune the DEX module from Beacon Chain.

## 2. Abstract
Currently there is a high performance DEX running on Beacon Chain.
After implementing this BEP, the DEX module will be disdisabled.

## 3. Status
This BEP is already implemented.

## 4. Motivation
The Beacon Chain will be more decentralized in the next stage. Prune the DEX module will reduce the need for system resources significantly for validators. The demand for DEX can be fulfilled by BNB Smart Chain or the upcoming zkBAS.

## 5. Specification
After the implementation of this BEP, the `NewOrderMsg` transaction will return an error to disable placing new orders.
All the pending orders will be canceled by users or by timeout.
Thus there will be no more DEX transactions on Beacon Chain.
